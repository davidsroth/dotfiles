# Git Organize Commits Command

Analyze unstaged/uncommitted changes and organize them into logical, well-structured commits following the repository's commit style conventions.

## Process

1. **Analyze Current State**
   - Run `git status` to see all changes
   - Run `git diff` to understand unstaged changes
   - Run `git diff --cached` to see staged changes
   - Run `git log --oneline -5` to understand commit style

2. **Group Related Changes**
   - Group changes by feature/purpose
   - Separate refactoring from features
   - Keep documentation updates separate
   - Group chore/maintenance tasks together

3. **Create Commits**
   - Use conventional commit format if repo uses it
   - Write clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Include context in commit body when helpful
   - Sign commits with Claude attribution

## Commit Types (Conventional Commits)

- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc)
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding missing tests
- **chore**: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit

## Example Commit Message Format

```
type(scope): short description

- Bullet point explaining what changed
- Another change in this commit
- Why this change was made (if not obvious)
