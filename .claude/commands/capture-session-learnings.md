# Session Review Command

Review session work and update documentation with discovered patterns, corrections, solutions, and insights.

Work from the beginning of the conversation through to the end noting:

- Mistakes and assumptions made
- Gaps in existing documentation
- Reusable patterns and solutions
- API patterns and behaviors discovered  
- Workflow optimizations found
- Error messages and their fixes
- Configuration requirements identified

## Where to Update

- **Existing files where appropriate**: Add sections, examples, clarifications, corrections
- **New memory files**: For new concepts/patterns
- **Local notes**: Project-specific findings (CLAUDE.local.md)

Prioritize supplementing existing documentation, and prioritize updating documentation nearer to the relevant code.

You may add/change up to {{lines|150}} lines.

## LINE LIMIT ENFORCEMENT

**CRITICAL**: You MUST stay within {{lines|150}} total line changes.

- Count EVERY added/modified line against this limit
- STOP immediately when approaching the limit
- Focus only on the most critical learnings

Think.
