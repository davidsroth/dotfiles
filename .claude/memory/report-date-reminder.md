# Report Date Reminder

Always include the current date at the top of any report, right after the title.

**CRITICAL**: Check the `<env>` section for "Today's date" rather than guessing. Don't assume "2025" means "January 2025".

Format:

```markdown
# Report Title

**Report Date**: Month Day, Year

[Report content...]
```

Example:

```markdown
# Model Usage Analysis Report

**Report Date**: July 18, 2025

[Report content...]
```
