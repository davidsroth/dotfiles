# Documentation Style Guidelines

When creating or updating documentation files, use factual and non-hyperbolic language.

## Language to Avoid

- Subjective quality descriptors: "enhanced", "improved", "better", "powerful", "modern"
- Marketing language: "comprehensive", "extensive", "advanced", "robust"
- Value judgments: "best practices", "optimal", "superior"
- Superlatives: "most", "fastest", "easiest"

## Language to Use

- Direct descriptions of functionality
- Specific technical details
- Concrete feature lists
- Factual statements about what exists or what something does

## Examples

### Avoid
- "Enhanced Git configuration with modern best practices"
- "Powerful terminal multiplexer with advanced features"
- "Comprehensive development environment"

### Prefer
- "Git configuration with aliases and custom settings"
- "Terminal multiplexer with session management"
- "Development environment configuration"

## Principle

State what something is and does, not how good it is at doing it.
