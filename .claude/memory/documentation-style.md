# Documentation Style

Use factual, non-hyperbolic language in documentation.

## Avoid

- Quality descriptors: enhanced, improved, better, powerful, modern
- Marketing language: comprehensive, extensive, advanced, robust
- Value judgments: best practices, optimal, superior
- Superlatives: most, fastest, easiest
- Parenthetical clarifications when unnecessary
- Negative framing: "not X" when you can state what it is

## Use Instead

- Direct functionality descriptions
- Specific technical details
- Concrete feature lists
- Factual statements

## Examples

Bad: "Enhanced Git configuration with modern best practices"  
Good: "Git configuration with aliases and custom settings"

Bad: "Powerful terminal multiplexer with advanced features"  
Good: "Terminal multiplexer with session management"

## Principle

State what something is and does, not how good it is at doing it.
Write with affirmative language: state what things are, not what they aren't.

## Line Counting

When counting lines for budgets, blank lines don't count toward the total - only content lines.

## Report Date
- Include a report date near the top
- Format: `Report Date: Month Day, Year`
- Source the date from the environment-provided value (not the system clock)
