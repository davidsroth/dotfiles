# Sunsama

**David's primary daily organization system** - manages work meetings, personal tasks, and time tracking.

Sunsama is a daily task planning and productivity tool that organizes work into:
- **Tasks**: Items with time estimates, notes, due dates, completion status
- **Streams/Channels**: Categories for organizing tasks (personal, work projects, etc.)
- **Daily Planning**: Tasks scheduled for specific days vs backlog
- **Time Tracking**: Planned vs actual time spent on tasks

Key workflow: Plan daily tasks, track time, complete items, review progress.
MCP provides task CRUD operations, scheduling, and basic properties management.
