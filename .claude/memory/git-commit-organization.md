# Git Commit Organization Workflow

Execute when user says "organize git changes into neat commits" or similar.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Initial Analysis (Run in Parallel)

```bash
git status          # See all changes
git diff            # Unstaged changes
git diff --cached   # Staged changes
git log --oneline -5  # Recent commit style
```

### 2. Organization Principles

- Atomic commits: One logical change per commit
- Type grouping: Group by conventional type (feat, fix, chore)
- Dependency order: Prerequisites before dependent changes
- File proximity: Keep related files together

### 3. Commit Message Format

```text
type(scope): description

- Detail 1
- Detail 2

### 4. Common Groupings

1. Infrastructure first: .gitignore, build configs, tooling
2. Refactoring second: Code cleanup, file reorganization  
3. Features third: New functionality
4. Documentation last: README updates, docs

### 5. Execution Pattern

```bash
git add <specific files>
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
type(scope): clear description

- What changed
- Why it changed

```

## Example Scenarios

Mixed changes:

- Deleted files â†’ `chore: remove deprecated files`
- Updated config â†’ `refactor(config): consolidate settings`
- Added .gitignore â†’ `chore: add .gitignore`
- Fixed bugs â†’ `fix: correct specific issue`

Feature development:

- Dependencies â†’ `chore(deps): add required packages`
- Implementation â†’ `feat(module): implement new feature`
- Tests â†’ `test(module): add feature tests`
- Documentation â†’ `docs: document new feature`

## Code Review (Condensed)
- Discovery: checkout PR branch, `git status`, read PR details/diffs, scan existing comments, confirm scope
- Analysis checklist: implementation changes, tests present/missing, security/compliance, code quality/standards
- Investigation: read changed files end-to-end, search for related patterns, spot missing pieces (esp. tests), verify repo standards
- Commenting: batch comments in a pending review, add context and examples, ask for confirmation before submitting
- Criteria: Critical (security/breaking/missing tests); Important (quality, errors, docs); Nice-to-have (organization, optimizations, follow-ups)
- Practices: track todos for completeness; link to existing patterns; prefer batched reviews; mix human judgment with technical analysis
